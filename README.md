# AI Gym

My solutions to OpenAI gym problems.

See [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) for the Gym documentation.

None of these work yet :'(

todo:
    - get `MonteCarloAgent` working on basic tests and non-slippery frozen lake
    - try [blackjack](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/blackjack.py)
    - investigate mini gridworld environments (https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid)
    - investigate universe
    - investigate step size schedule (1/k^0.5?)
    - try keep track of an epsilon for each state based on
      how many times it's been visited (or something)
