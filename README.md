# AI Gym

My solutions to OpenAI gym problems.

See [here](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) for the Gym documentation.

None of these work yet :'(

todo:
    - investigate universe
    - write unit tests for agents?
    - investigate step size schedule (1/k^0.5?)
    - investigate episilon schedule (max(0.1, 1/k^0.5?))
    - try keep track of an epsilon for each state based on
      how many times it's been visited (or something)
